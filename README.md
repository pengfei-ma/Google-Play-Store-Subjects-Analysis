## Describe here your project


Pengfei Ma CS777 term project


# Submit your python scripts .py 

project_entire_script.py


Gradient Descent finding parameters.py


multi-linear regression.py


are all code files. Gradient Descent finding parameters.py and multi-linear regression.py are parts of project_entire_script.py. Exact the same code in  project_entire_script.py

# Other Documents. 

Google-Playstore.csv is the data set used in this project.


Jupyter Notebook file "Project Presentation demo.ipynb" is for presentation used and screen recording. It contains the output of the project.


"Project Proposal" is the word file about the project.


"Project Presentation with OUTPUT.pdf" is the PDF file that exported from "Project Presentation demo.ipynb" It contained all code of the project and all OUTPUT of the project as well. 


"GD parameter.png" is the diagram of the cost for the GD


"multi-linear regression.png" is the diagram of the cost of multi-linear regression.

# How to run  

Run "project_entire_script.py" is enough. 

Comment the following code to run local

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
	if len(sys.argv) != 3:
		print("Usage: wordcount <file> <output> ", file=sys.stderr)
		exit(-1)
```
shift + tab to move code forward in order to run locally.


Run "Gradient Descent finding parameters.py" and "multi-linear regression.py" to see the process and the diagram.
